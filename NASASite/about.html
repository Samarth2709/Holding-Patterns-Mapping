                    <p>Hannah Treehan is a rising senior from California. She was part of the research team, and she researched current systems of holding patterns and current efforts to reduce the environmental impact of aviation. She also helped analyze
                        and discuss the solutions that the team brainstormed. In her free time, Hannah is a student pilot and enjoys volunteering in aviation outreach efforts, such as building flight simulator pods for the community and introducing young
                        girls to aviation. She also loves reading, music, and spending time with friends.</p>

                    <p>Samarth Kumbla is a rising Junior at Valley Chrisitan High School in San Jose, California. He created a python program that pulls nation-wide carbon emission data from the EIA and visualizes it on interactive maps. The live maps display
                        EIA carbon emission data from multiple aircraft fuel types for many years. The map also depicts the locations of major airports in the United States and the outline of the aviation centers. In Samarth's free time, he can be found
                        fencing, playing video games, and hanging out with friends.</p>
