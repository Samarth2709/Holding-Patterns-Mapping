                    <p class="lead">Our research revolved around carbon emissions and holding patterns. The research team analyzed carbon emissions statistics to build a better understanding of the existing issues revolving around sustainability in aviation. As air travel
                        expands, the negative impact of carbon emissions grows. When building our proposal, we reviewed current holding patterns and procedures.</p>

                <div class="a">
                    <p class="lead">Despite the global Covid-19 pandemic, commercial aviation will increase in popularity. For comparison, Jeff Overton writes for the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), “In 1960, 100 million passengers traveled by air… By
                        2017, the total annual world-wide passenger count was 4 billion.” This results in an increase in carbon emissions, a trend that has been shown in ongoing data. According to The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT),
                        commercial aviation emitted 918 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2019, increasing 29% from 2013. It is in the best interests of airlines, consumers, and the environment to decrease unnecessary flight minutes to minimize
                        carbon emissions.</p>

                    <p class="lead">In regards to current holding procedures, holding patterns are layered. As described in our final report, “Standard holding patterns – unless specified otherwise by ATC – are flown in right traffic, with four distinct legs, and with
                        a leg length of 1 minute (or 1.5 minutes, depending on altitude). Patterns are anchored by a “holding fix” such as a VOR or other marker.” Upon researching holding patterns, a focus of our research was speed limits. The restrictions
                        vary based on altitude, but can be “broken” depending on instructions given by ATC.</p>

                    <p class="lead">After building an understanding of the carbon emissions contributed by aircraft and the detrimental environmental impact, we shifted our focus to current holding patterns. Having done this research, we constructed our proposals.</p>
